# [Unreleased] bugfix release

## Added

- The frontpage is now visible.  You can see it by going to `/` in the url bar.
  (#56)
- The codebase is now tested!  I'm pretty sure we are one of the only GTK apps
  which has proper UI tests - so this should stop more regressions into the
  future!

## Changed

- Replaced the markdown engine, should now support more features (#66)
- The alignment in subreddit listings should now be more uniform. (#64)
- The subreddit listings should now be more responsively sized. (#47)
- The url bar is now less lenient on formatting.  Previously, going to `/linux`
  would take you to `/r/linux`.  Due to the frontpage changes, this no longer
  happens
