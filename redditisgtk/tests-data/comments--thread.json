Such a short time span leaves one feeling empty. Fill that void with good memories, smiles, and warm thoughts. \n\nI still occasionally mourn over my late cat, Chester. He lived a right old life and was my companion through childhood into young adult life. The pain will never go away, but you reduce it and come to terms with it. Let it inspire you to be a better human. Recently, a friend of mine passed away, almost in secret; this individual challenged me to teach and learn all that I could. \n\nThe pain is no different, losing a human friend or an an animal friend. They are our family. \n\nTake pride in knowing that you gave your pets the best life you could. Our animals never ask us to be perfect, and I have faith that your pets had vibrant and healthy lives with you, because of you. \n\nI have seen homeless people starve themselves so that their pet may eat and continue living.

Then I started getting shorted hours, and they were being given away to people I had just trained. I had 4 hours a week at the end.\n\nSo cue the weekend before my birthday this year, in February, and also the day before the Super Bowl. Wednesday, I thought I had a cold. Thursday, I was pretty sure had strep, but felt better Friday, so I went in to cover for someone. I was losing my voice by the end of the night. Saturday morning, I woke up with no voice, a fever, and so much pain. Called around, no one could cover for me (after everything I had done for everyone else, too; I must have covered for one guy\u2019s hangovers every other weekend). I called my manager\u2014and keep in mind, I could barely talk at all\u2014and tell him I have strep and am going to urgent care, and no one can cover for me. Cue literal screaming into the phone, about how this isn\u2019t his problem and I\u2019m so irresponsible, ending with \u201cwell I don\u2019t have anyone to cover for you\u201d and hanging up on me.\n\nI started bawling. I didn\u2019t know what to do for a good 15 minutes, and this was 4 hours before my shift, plenty of time to call in. Another manager ended up covering for me, I went to urgent care\u2014and ended up having strep AND a nasty strain of the flu. Mandatory bed rest for a week, I missed 3 more shifts. I texted the manager who covered for me, and she said she would take care of it. When I got back, I asked the GM if he wanted to see my doctor\u2019s note. He declined and avoided me.\n\nTL;DR: Manager thought I was faking strep and the flu to get a long birthday weekend/the super bowl off. I went to the doctor and was put on bed rest for a week.\n\nAnd yes, I was on bed rest over my birthday.

I had 4 hours a week at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo cue the weekend before my birthday this year, in February, and also the day before the Super Bowl. Wednesday, I thought I had a cold. Thursday, I was pretty sure had strep, but felt better Friday, so I went in to cover for someone. I was losing my voice by the end of the night. Saturday morning, I woke up with no voice, a fever, and so much pain. Called around, no one could cover for me (after everything I had done for everyone else, too; I must have covered for one guy\u2019s hangovers every other weekend). I called my manager\u2014and keep in mind, I could barely talk at all\u2014and tell him I have strep and am going to urgent care, and no one can cover for me. Cue literal screaming into the phone, about how this isn\u2019t his problem and I\u2019m so irresponsible, ending with \u201cwell I don\u2019t have anyone to cover for you\u201d and hanging up on me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI started bawling. I didn\u2019t know what to do for a good 15 minutes, and this was 4 hours before my shift, plenty of time to call in. Another manager ended up covering for me, I went to urgent care\u2014and ended up having strep AND a nasty strain of the flu. Mandatory bed rest for a week, I missed 3 more shifts. I texted the manager who covered for me, and she said she would take care of it. When I got back, I asked the GM if he wanted to see my doctor\u2019s note. He declined and avoided me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Manager thought I was faking strep and the flu to get a long birthday weekend/the super bowl off. I went to the doctor and was put on bed rest for a week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I was on bed rest over my birthday. Not a bad way to spend it, actually, in bed with no where to be...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9vzevr/you_need_a_doctors_note_you_got_it/e9gywn6/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_e9gywn6", "created": 1541951635.0, "subreddit": "MaliciousCompliance", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1541922835.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MaliciousCompliance", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3boqz", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_9vzevr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3boqz", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_9vzevr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "e9gf00t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "psychic_mudkip", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_e9gexdg", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_onbs0", "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I wouldn\u2019t trust Dwight with a vacuum cleaner!\n\nI love The Office though.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u2019t trust Dwight with a vacuum cleaner!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI love The Office though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E", "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9vzevr/you_need_a_doctors_note_you_got_it/e9gf00t/", "num_reports": null, "name": "t1_e9gf00t", "created": 1541927875.0, "subreddit": "MaliciousCompliance", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1541899075.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MaliciousCompliance", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "e9gexdg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "adampetey", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_9vzevr", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_1vbkxg5e", "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Was your cat named Sprinkles?

We had a fenale lead who absolutely hated men. Made my life hell specifically because I\u2019m a real choll, go with the flow, kinda guy. Never bothered by much, except her. She\u2019d give me the worst jobs, the shittiest reveiws, tried to have me fired multiple times. Failed every time too, which made it all worse. More my point, I went home feeling off on one day, which she said to call in if I go under. No big deal. The next day I\u2019m unable to even get out of bed, so I call in. To quote her, \u201cdon\u2019t come back without a doctor\u2019s note, and if you don\u2019t have one by the end of friday, don\u2019t come back at all\u201d. So I\u2019m a temp, it\u2019s thursday at 5, and the fridaythat she spoke of, most doctors aren\u2019t available for routine things like this  at the hospital I\u2019d go to. Well she didn\u2019t realize I went to the military hospital, which just so happened to have family practice available until 7. So I get to the doctor, the doc tells me it\u2019s probably a cold, but asked why it was such short notice. I told her, and she laughed, and asked how long I\u2019d need off. I ended up taking a nice vacation for about four work days after that. How did I get the note in you ask?

We had a fenale lead who absolutely hated men. Made my life hell specifically because I\u2019m a real choll, go with the flow, kinda guy. Never bothered by much, except her. She\u2019d give me the worst jobs, the shittiest reveiws, tried to have me fired multiple times. Failed every time too, which made it all worse. More my point, I went home feeling off on one day, which she said to call in if I go under. No big deal. The next day I\u2019m unable to even get out of bed, so I call in. To quote her, \u201cdon\u2019t come back without a doctor\u2019s note, and if you don\u2019t have one by the end of friday, don\u2019t come back at all\u201d. So I\u2019m a temp, it\u2019s thursday at 5, and the fridaythat she spoke of, most doctors aren\u2019t available for routine things like this  at the hospital I\u2019d go to. Well she didn\u2019t realize I went to the military hospital, which just so happened to have family practice available until 7. So I get to the doctor, the doc tells me it\u2019s probably a cold, but asked why it was such short notice. I told her, and she laughed, and asked how long I\u2019d need off. I ended up taking a nice vacation for about four work days after that. How did I get the note in you ask? Well it just so happens my Dad works in the same place I do, so he gladly handed it to her, knowing the situation full well.
